        <h3>Navagio Beach (Shipwreck Beach)</h3>
        <img src="./assets/img/boat.jpg" alt="">
        <div class="text">
        <p><strong>Location:</strong> Navagio Beach is situated on the northwestern coast of Zakynthos, accessible only by sea due to its secluded location.</p>
        <p><strong>Distinctive Feature:</strong> The beach gets its name, Navagio, which means "shipwreck" in Greek, from the shipwreck of the MV Panagiotis. The ship, which ran aground in the early 1980s while allegedly smuggling contraband, still lies partially buried in the white sands of the beach.</p>
        <p><strong>Crystal-Clear Waters:</strong> Navagio Beach is celebrated for its stunning turquoise waters and dramatic limestone cliffs that surround the pristine bay. The contrasting colors of the azure sea, golden sand, and white cliffs create a mesmerizing and picturesque landscape.</p>
        <p><strong>Access:</strong> Visitors typically reach Navagio Beach by taking boat tours that depart from various points around the island, particularly from the nearby port of Agios Nikolaos. These boat trips not only provide access to the beach but also offer panoramic views of the coastline and the famous shipwreck.</p>
        <p><strong>Activities:</strong> Once at Navagio Beach, visitors can swim in the crystal-clear waters, relax on the beach, and explore the rusty remains of the shipwreck. The beach can get busy during peak tourist season, but its beauty and unique history make it a must-visit destination.</p>
        <p><strong>Viewpoints:</strong> For those who prefer not to go down to the beach, there are several viewpoints along the cliffs that offer breathtaking panoramic views of Navagio Beach. These viewpoints provide excellent photo opportunities, capturing the shipwreck and the surrounding landscape from a higher vantage point.</p>
